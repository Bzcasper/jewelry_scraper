1. Proxy Rotation and User-Agent Spoofing
Overview
To enhance scraping resilience and avoid being blocked by target websites, the application implements proxy rotation and user-agent spoofing.

Proxy Rotation
Proxy Manager: Located at scraper/utils/proxy_manager.py, it handles fetching and rotating proxies from the proxies.txt file.

Configuration:

python
Copy code

# scraper/utils/proxy_manager.py

PROXY_LIST_PATH = 'config/proxies.txt'
Usage: The proxy manager automatically assigns a proxy to each request and rotates it upon encountering blocks.

User-Agent Spoofing
Implementation: Custom user-agent strings are set in the spider's settings.
python
Copy code

# scraper/spiders/base.py

custom_settings = {
    'USER_AGENT': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...'
}
Dynamic Rotation: Implement dynamic rotation of user-agent strings to mimic different browsers and devices.
2. Error Logging and Notifications
Error Logging
Logger Setup: Configured in backend/logger.py to capture and store error logs.

python
Copy code
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.ERROR,
    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("logs/error.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
Usage: Log errors throughout the application to aid in debugging and monitoring.

Notifications
Email Alerts: Configure the application to send email notifications for critical errors.

python
Copy code
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_error_notification(error_message):
    msg = MIMEText(error_message)
    msg['Subject'] = 'Jewelry Scraper Critical Error'
    msg['From'] = '<alert@example.com>'
    msg['To'] = '<admin@example.com>'

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com') as server:
        server.login('user', 'password')
        server.send_message(msg)
Integration: Call the send_error_notification function within exception handlers.

3. Database Backups
Manual Backup
Trigger Backup:
bash
Copy code
GET <http://localhost:5000/backup>
Storage: Backups are saved in the data/backups/ directory with timestamped filenames.
Automated Backups
Scheduler Setup: Use a scheduler (e.g., APScheduler) to automate daily backups.

python
Copy code
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

def backup_database():
    # Backup logic
    pass

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
scheduler.add_job(backup_database, 'interval', hours=24)
scheduler.start()
Verification: Regularly verify backups to ensure data integrity.

4. Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions Workflow
Workflow File: Located at .github/workflows/python-app.yml.

Features:

Automated Testing: Runs tests on every commit.
Linting: Checks code quality using linters.
Build Verification: Ensures that the application builds successfully.
Example Workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
        pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        pip install flake8
        flake8 backend/

    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        pytest backend/tests/
Benefits
Automated Quality Checks: Ensures code quality and functionality before merging.
Early Detection: Identifies issues early in the development process.
5. Data Visualization
DataDashboard Component
Location: frontend/src/components/DataDashboard.js
Features:
Charts and Graphs: Visual representations of scraped data (e.g., price distributions, category breakdowns).
Real-time Updates: Automatically refreshes data to reflect the latest information.
Interactive Elements: Allows users to interact with the data (e.g., hover for details, filter specific metrics).
Implementation
Chart.js Integration:

javascript
Copy code
import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

const DataDashboard = () => {
    // Data fetching and state management
    return (
        <Bar data={chartData} options={chartOptions} />
    );
};
Customization: Customize chart types, colors, and data points to suit user needs.

6. Performance Optimization
Database Indexing
Purpose: Improves query performance by creating indexes on frequently searched fields.

SQL Statements:

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_products_platform ON products(platform);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_date ON products(date_scraped);
Implementation: Execute these statements in your database client or include them in migration scripts.

Caching Strategy
Redis Caching: Utilizes Redis to cache frequent queries and reduce database load.

python
Copy code
from flask_caching import Cache

cache = Cache(config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'redis', 'CACHE_REDIS_URL': 'redis://localhost:6379/0'})
cache.init_app(app)
Usage Example:

python
Copy code
@cache.cached(timeout=300, key_prefix='all_products')
def get_all_products():
    # Fetch products from the database
    pass
Batch Processing
Asynchronous Processing: Handles multiple items concurrently to enhance performance.

python
Copy code
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def process_batch(self, items):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [self.process_item(item, session) for item in items]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
Implementation: Integrate batch processing in the scraper orchestrator to manage large datasets efficiently.

7. System Scalability
Migrating to PostgreSQL
Benefits: Improved performance, scalability, and support for advanced features compared to SQLite.

Steps:

Install PostgreSQL:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Create Database and User:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE jewelry_scraper;
CREATE USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE jewelry_scraper TO yourusername;
Update Configuration: Modify the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to PostgreSQL.
Distributed Scraping
Implementation: Distribute scraping tasks across multiple machines or processes to handle larger volumes.

Tools: Utilize tools like Celery for task queue management.

python
Copy code
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('scraper', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def scrape_product(query):
    # Scraping logic
    pass
Redis Caching
Benefits: Enhances performance by caching frequent queries and managing distributed locks.

Setup: Ensure Redis is installed and running.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo service redis-server start
8. Monitoring & Analytics
Performance Metrics
Tracked Metrics:
Scraping Success Rate: Percentage of successful scraping operations.
Response Times: Time taken to respond to API requests.
Error Rates: Frequency and types of errors encountered.
Resource Usage: CPU, memory, and network usage.
Tools
Prometheus: Collects and stores metrics data.
Grafana: Visualizes metrics through customizable dashboards.
Setting Up Dashboards
Configure Prometheus:

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:

- job_name: 'jewelry_scraper'
    static_configs:
  - targets: ['backend:5000']
Create Grafana Dashboards: Import pre-built dashboards or create custom ones to visualize metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and request rates.

Alerting
Set up alerts for critical performance thresholds to enable proactive issue resolution.

yaml
Copy code

# Example Prometheus alert rule

groups:

- name: jewelry_scraper_alerts
    rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "The error rate has exceeded 5% for the past 5 minutes."
